This was a week-long project to make my goal of completing all the "Daily Levels" in "Geometry Dash." I copy and pasted a list of all the previous levels from someone's steam post (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828377729) and pasted them into txt files respective to their year. Then, I pain-stakingly sorted all of the information and organized it to get pasted into a large google sheet that I could manipulate further.
